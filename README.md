# Pharmacology-ANKI
Pharmacology flash cards for key concepts and MOAs.

## Getting Started

This project relies on the use of a third party flashcard software called ANKI.

Download [ANKI](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and intall it on your computer.

Then download these ANKI package (apkg) files from here.

Now you can import the files into ANKI and start learning key ideas and facts that will help increase your familiarity with pharmacology in the fastest way possible.

## Detailed Instructions for Mac and PC Users

See the [Getting Started with ANKI](Getting_started_with_Anki_16Jul19.pdf) guide (in the list of files above) for a brief explanation of the rationale behind this project and detailed instructions for importing the apkg files in both Mac and PC environments.
